The roots of the Sudoku puzzle are in the Switzerland. Leonhard Euler created "carr√© latin" in the 18h century which is similar to a Sudoku puzzle but without the additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. The first real Sudoku was published in 1979 and was invented by Howard Garns, an American architect. The real world wide popularity started in Japan in 1986 after it was published and given the name Sudoku by Nikoli.
