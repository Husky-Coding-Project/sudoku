            Try looking at which values can possibly go into a square; if there is only one possible
            value, then the square must hold that value. You can extend this and look at an entire
            row, column or box using this strategy!
        </p>

        <p class="strategy_subtext">
            No guessing is required to solve a sudoku puzzle; think carefully about how a value in
            one square would affect the entire puzzle!
