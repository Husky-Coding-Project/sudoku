        <p class="about_content">
            Sudoku is an easy to learn logic-based number placement puzzle. The word Sudoku is short
            for the Japanese phrase "su-ji wa dokushin ni kagiru," which means "the numbers must be
            single". The roots of the Sudoku puzzle can be found in Switzerland. Leonhard Euler
            created "carr√© latin" in the 18th century, which is similar to a Sudoku puzzle but
            without the additionalconstraint on the contents of individual regions. The first modern
            Sudoku puzzle was published in 1979 by Howard Garns, an American architect. Sudoku became
            popular worldwide in 1986 after it was published and given the name Sudoku by Nikoli, a
            Japanese puzzle company.
